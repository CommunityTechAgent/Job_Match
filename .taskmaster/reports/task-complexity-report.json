			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Update Supabase Jobs Table Schema for Airtable Integration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase jobs table schema update task into subtasks covering schema design, implementation, and testing. Include specific steps for adding new fields, creating indexes, updating RLS policies, and verifying backward compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves database schema changes which are moderately complex. The requirements are well-defined with specific fields and indexes to add. Breaking it into design, implementation, and testing phases would ensure a systematic approach. The complexity is moderate because schema changes require careful planning to avoid breaking existing functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Airtable Base Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Airtable base configuration task into subtasks covering initial setup and field configuration, view creation, and API credential generation. Include detailed steps for each field type and view configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task is straightforward with clear requirements for setting up an Airtable base. The complexity is relatively low as it involves following Airtable's UI to create fields and views. The main challenge is ensuring all fields have the correct types and configurations, which is well-documented in the task details."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Airtable API Integration Library",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Airtable API integration library implementation into subtasks covering environment setup, client initialization, data fetching with rate limiting, error handling, and CRUD operations. Include specific implementation details for each function.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves API integration with rate limiting and error handling, which adds complexity. The code needs to handle network failures, API throttling, and data transformation. Breaking it into subtasks for setup, core functionality, error handling, and testing would make it more manageable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Job Data Transformer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the job data transformer implementation into subtasks covering data validation, sanitization, transformation logic, and bidirectional mapping. Include specific handling for different data types and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires careful data transformation between two systems with validation and sanitization. The complexity comes from handling various data types, ensuring data integrity, and implementing security measures like HTML sanitization. Edge cases and data validation add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Job Sync API Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the job sync API endpoint implementation into subtasks covering authentication/authorization, data fetching from Airtable, comparison with existing Supabase data, insert/update operations, and error handling/reporting. Include specific implementation details for each component.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines multiple complex elements: API authentication, role-based access control, data synchronization between systems, and error handling. It requires careful transaction management and has dependencies on multiple other tasks. The endpoint needs to handle various edge cases and potential failures."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Upload System for Resumes",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the resume upload system implementation into subtasks covering Supabase Storage configuration, file validation, upload component with progress tracking, file management, and security policies. Include specific implementation details for each component.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves file handling, progress tracking, validation, and security considerations. The complexity comes from managing file uploads with progress indicators, implementing proper validation, generating secure URLs, and setting up appropriate security policies. User experience considerations add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Simple Keyword-Based Matching Algorithm",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the job matching algorithm implementation into subtasks covering user profile data retrieval, job data retrieval, scoring algorithm implementation, match reason generation, and results presentation. Include specific implementation details for each scoring factor.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves algorithm design and implementation with multiple scoring factors. The complexity comes from designing a scoring system that effectively matches users with jobs based on various criteria. The algorithm needs to handle different data types and generate meaningful match explanations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Email Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the email notification system implementation into subtasks covering Resend.com integration, email template design, notification triggering logic, and unsubscribe functionality. Include specific implementation details for each component.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves third-party API integration and email template design. The complexity is moderate as it requires setting up the email service, creating HTML templates, and implementing unsubscribe functionality. Error handling for failed email sends adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Enhanced Profile Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhanced profile management system implementation into subtasks covering database schema updates, profile image upload component, form validation, skills selector component, education/experience management, and data persistence. Include specific implementation details for each component.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves multiple UI components, form validation, file uploads, and complex data structures. The profile form has many fields with different data types and validation requirements. The skills selector component adds additional complexity with its suggestion and categorization features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Automated Airtable Sync System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the automated Airtable sync system implementation into subtasks covering sync logic implementation, cron job configuration, authentication/security, logging/monitoring, and admin dashboard development. Include specific implementation details for each component.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a scheduled job system with proper logging, error handling, and monitoring. The complexity comes from ensuring reliable synchronization, handling potential failures, and providing visibility into the sync process. The admin dashboard adds UI complexity to the task."
